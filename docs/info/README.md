### Course Description

In this studio course, we will be focusing on the creation of published work for web browser. Students will learn foundational, front-end languages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in order to produce creative content for web distribution. In this course, we will also cover the fundamentals of graphic design and typography. No prior knowledge is required.

We will explore the past, the present and the future of the internet and its outputs. We will work from an open-ended definition of interactivity: any reciprocal action between two or more parties. With this definition, what a website looks like and how it can function opens up. Students are required to come to class prepared with questions and concerns. This is not a tutorial class.
 
We, all together, will use the class time to solve problem-based questions. Each student is expected to work autonomously at home. There will be a lot of making this semester, both in class and out, and you will be coding everything from scratch. The idea being that hands on making is the best way to learn, and that coding is a form of thinking. Whether interested in coding and making websites or not, the ideas of “interactivity” can be applied to any practice. I am excited to work with you, and encourage everyone to step outside of their comfort zone and have fun in the process! Our work focuses on processes rather than products: things that adapt to their environment, emphasize change and show difference.

It’s your responsibility to check the class website interactiveweb.site/hunter-spring2020 to stay up to date with the exercises, reading and communication. Every week I will upload the past week lesson + the full exercise for the week after.
