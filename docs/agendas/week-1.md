#### Homework

1. Complete [this signup sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZLs2MEZhbOPJz6kPV7nZ0nnJnQ0087rqwlZyL0UbFCY/edit?usp=sharing), with:

   - Your preferred first name
   - Your GitHub Repo link
   - Your Github Pages URL
   - Signup for a date to present a public website to the class which you find interesting
     <blockquote>Every class will begin with a student presenting on a public website they find interesting. The student is expected to facilitate a discussion with the class to dig into how the site was built. Explanations and outstanding questions are expected. These will begin begin in our Week 3 class meeting on Feb 7th. Post your submission on your Github page prior to your week.</blockquote>

1. Add structure (HTML) and style (CSS) to your course index page hosted on Github Pages. You should find a creative but logical way to organize the content you create throughout Core Interaction (Lab + Studio). You will maintain this page thoughout the entire semester, so it doesn't need to be perfect just yet. Just make sure <i>_something_</i> is published by next class.

   - Don't forget to check our [resources page](../resources) for the class! Simone and Andrew will keep an updated list as we progress through the class. There will likely be multiple free, public resources added each week to assist you with your assignments.

<b>Due Date:</b> By the start of the next lab, 1/31

::: warning Reminder
You will add your homework assignments and projects to your Github Pages site as they become due. Since we review these assignments at the start of class, late work <b>cannot</b> be accepted.
