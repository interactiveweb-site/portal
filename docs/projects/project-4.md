# E-Reader

We will collect all the readings of this class, into an online publications. <br>
In additional to the readings, we will add: 

- Your weekly question
- Your pair presentation

Every <strong>Tuesday</strong>, one person will be selected to answer three questions from the class about the readings. Every question will become part of the online publication. 

Every <strong>Thursday</strong>, two people will be selected to present the readings for that day. The pair needs to present the reading in a format of a ‘publication’ (4 pages total). It’s totally up to you how you want to summarize and design these 4 pages. You can use: images, text, video, GIF, hyperlink, websites, etc. These 4 pages will be added to our online publications. You don’t need to send me the presentation before class. I will need the 4 pages the day after your presentation. 

By the end of the semester, I will export the E-Reader for you.
