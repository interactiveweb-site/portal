# E-Reader

We will collect all the readings of this class, into an online publications.
Create an account on are.na every week I will upload all the readings. 
By Fridays at 11.59pm submit a question regarding the reading using the arena channel. Always say: your name, the title of the reading and your questions. Additional to the question you need to submit one (1) image (could be a .gif, a video, a website, etc..). <br>

Every week two people will present the reading using the are.na channel. 
This pair needs to be sure to add at least 3 additional images to help describe the readings. The pair will need to respond to three (3) questions the other people, verbally in class. <br>

By the end of the semester, we will export and print* our are.na channel to keep a memento of this course. <br>
