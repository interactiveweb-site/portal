# It's Alive!


### Description

Read the first chapter of ‘Things: A Story of the Sixties by George Perec’. You will need to create a website to translate the printed words of the book into an online website. Week by week, using first HTML, consequently CSS you will translate the printed words of the book into a published website. Your reader will not only be able to read the story but also experience your interpretation of the story. You may use one page or multiple pages to convey this experience.

### Due Date(s)
February, 29th

Critique day! 
We will collect all the website in a giant online garden. Come to class prepared to explain your project for 3 minutes. Everyone will write a critique of the project in a little piece of paper and it would be collected.
