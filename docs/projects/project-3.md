Creating a website for a collection of your personal place. Take at least 30 images of your current home and we will create a collection based on those pictures. The design should be flexible to allow other images to be included later. A collection is the action and the process to collect a group of things. You can choose images from the web if you want to explore an imaginary space, however the ideas behind that collection should be original.  The website should max 3 HTML pages and 1 CSS file and 1 JavaScript.
